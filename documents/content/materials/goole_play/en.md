### Description
This app is for use in Japan.  
Officially provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW), this app notifies you of close contact with COVID-19 positive users to help the government and healthcare organizations contain the spread of COVID-19.

The app recognizes close contacts (within 1 meter, 15 minutes or more) between smartphones running this app. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can register anonymously in this app. If you have been in close contact with a user who tested positive, the app notifies you of potential infection and provides guidance to protect your health.

You can stop recording close contacts anytime. Turn on recording the settings in the app or delete the app.


■ How to ‘close contact’ is recorded  
This app records ‘close contact’ by using Bluetooth and Exposure Notification API provided by Apple.

When you run this app, each smartphone generates a random code. This code changes every 10-20 mintutes

When smartphones running this app are in close contact, they exchange random codes. Received codes are stored only on the devices.


■ Receiving close contact notifications  
Users who tested COVID-19 positive, can choose to share the random codes that their devices have sent out. Each device periodically checks if it has previously encountered any of the shared codes. If the code shared by a COVID-19 positive user matches with a code stored on your device, you will be notified that you have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive user and provides guidance to protect your health.

To receive notifications of close contact with COVID-19 positive users, you need to download this app and enable exposure notification function on operating system. The app only works with others who have the official app installed

Depending on the symptoms, you will be advised to take a COVID-19 test. You will also find instructions if you want to reach out healthcare organizations by phone.
